# Overview
PlainFlight stabilisation software is for the RC pilot who wants to get the most from their model, needs to master an unstable aircraft, or simply counteract environmental conditions for a more enjoyable flight.

Originally created as a home project for fixed wing model aircraft and with the intent of trying to replicate the adaptability and ease of build that the [MultiWii](https://code.google.com/archive/p/multiwii/) project had from many years ago. It quickly met my expectations with its predefined model mixes, quick customisation, good performance, ease of build and low budget parts. These qualities led to friends wanting it on their models and ultimately PlainFlight being refined and posted on GitHub for other hobbyists to have a go and enjoy.

While PlainFlight has been developed for small electric powered model planes it could easily be modified and used upon other small radio-controlled craft. This can be done with little effort as the code is broken down into logical modules and is well commented for those that want to understand or modify for their own purposes.

Several default pre-programmed model mixes can be chosen: Full house plane, full house plane V-tail (Talon), rudder/elevator plane, V-tail plane, or flying wing. The default code settings will compile for a 'full house plane' with control of 4 servo and 2 motor outputs, giving controls of ailerons/flap x2, elevator, rudder and throttle x2 (differential throttle also available for twin motor options).

The flight controller hardware is based upon the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3, chosen for its small size, 32bit processing power and low cost. When combined with the ever-popular MPU6050 IMU a 1KHz control loop rate is achieved which is more than ample for fixed wing aircraft. 

If you appreciate the time and effort I have invested in this project for the community, then please help me continue development with a kind gesture (Thank you):

## Hardware:

All hardware is readily avaialble from hobbyist electronics shops with the main components being:

**Seeed Studio:** [XIAO ESP32-S3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

**MPU6050:** [GY-521 Breakout Board](https://www.amazon.co.uk/MPU-6050-Accelerometer-Gyroscope-Converter-Arduino/dp/B0BZXT477Z/ref=sr_1_7?crid=1PUDPKVVKYGMW&keywords=gy-521%2Bmpu6050%2Bimu&qid=1700420083&sprefix=GY-521%2Caps%2C316&sr=8-7&th=1)

The following wiring diagram details how to assemble the flight controller from component parts for a typical model. For full details on wiring and setup please see instructions/directions manual:

## Instruction Manual:

The plainFlightController repository includes a comprehensive instruction manual that takes you through Arduino and flight controller setup for your model:

Testing the effect of D-gain on a fixed wing model. Despite popular belief it works and from my experiences has the benefit of softening P gain 'bobbles' caused by overshoot, and removes the need for throttle attenuation of gains. NOTE: You will need a laptop sized screen for this video:

## In Development

**Conversion to C++:** Improves existing code structure, will also use base class to support model types.
**Inclusion of multicopters:** Use of multicopter base class to support quad, chinook and bicopter.
**Configurator App:** WiFi / web browser configurator - This gives you the ability to use your smart device to set flight controller parameters whilst out flying.

These changes have been implemented and are being flight tested. 

## Planned

**IMU Board Orientation:** Allow alternative mounting options for IMU via defines.
